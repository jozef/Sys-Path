Revision history for Sys-Path
0.14    6 Feb 2015
        - use File::Spec->canonpath to pass the cwd test on win32 paltforms
        - mantain the same version in all packages (cpants);

        - add note before promting users during distribution installation
          (thanks to Daniel Perrett)

0.12    21 Sep 2011
        - find distribution root even when distribution lib/ path is not in @INC
          (thanks to Salve J. Nilsen)

0.11    10 Aug 2011
        - now considering Build.PL and Makefile.PL when finding distribution root
          (needed for `./Build disttest` where the t/ folder is not copied)
        - add srvdir (/srv)

0.10    03 Nov 2009
        - Pod updates

0.09    22 Oct 2009
        - removed the Module::Build::SysPath from this distribution
          + moved shareable functions from Module::Build::SysPath to
          Sys::Path so that they can be used by other build/install
          systems than Module::Build (thanks to Daxim!)
        - removed support for $HOME/.syspath/SPc.pm. makes kind of no
          sense as if the non-privileged user will be installing modules
          using system Perl to his folder, he can as well configure and
          install Sys::Path with his home configuration (thanks to Daxim)
        - moved SPc to Sys::Path::SPc

0.08    9 Sep 2009
        - store paths from initial run of `perl Build.PL`
          (install can be run as root so homedir configuration will change)
        - sharedstatedir (/var/lib) added
        - conffiles support
        - make conffiles and sharedstatedir files writeable
        - added webdir (/var/www)
        - will not auto install files from cachedir logdir spooldir rundir lockdir sharedstatedir webdir
